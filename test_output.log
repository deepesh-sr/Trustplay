(node:32881) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///Users/deepeshsinghrathore/Projects/superearn/trustplay_program/tests/trustplay_program.ts is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /Users/deepeshsinghrathore/Projects/superearn/trustplay_program/package.json.
